I prepaired this project with Dominika Gimzicka for subject Structured Data Processing as part of my Data Science studies.
## Objective
We wanted to check if number 13 causes that flying is unlucky. 
We were looking for number 13 in 3 columns: number of day, number of flight and number of plane.

## Data
We used: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7

## The course of project
Firstly, we prepaired data - created tables that shiny app uses and this tables are in "tabelki" folder.
Later, we created plots and integrated them to our shiny app
Unfortunately, most things are in my native language - polish. Future project will be fully in english.

## Results
Results are interesting, but we have not demonstrated any correlation between delays, cancellations, and the occurrence of the number 13.
